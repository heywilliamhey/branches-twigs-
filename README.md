A week ago I didn't know the difference between the Internet and the world wide web. I now have a better understanding and have found that using a metaphor created a clear image for me. If you imagine the Internet as a house with a million, billion doors then the Web is the stamp on a letter being sent to each door. I like this visual of how the communication between the two works. In this same scenario, it's helpful to think of DNS as being the number on each door in the house. You can even think of hackers knocking on each door to see if anyone is home.
